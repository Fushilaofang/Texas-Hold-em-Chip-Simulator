/workspaces/Texas-Hold-em-Chip-Simulator/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: Your app is currently not handling Selected Photos Access introduced in Android 14+ [SelectedPhotoAccess]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SelectedPhotoAccess":
   Selected Photo Access is a new ability for users to share partial access to
   their photo library when apps request access to their device storage on
   Android 14+.

   Instead of letting the system manage the selection lifecycle, we recommend
   you adapt your app to handle partial access to the photo library.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/workspaces/Texas-Hold-em-Chip-Simulator/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:23: Warning: Expecting android:screenOrientation="unspecified" or "fullSensor" for this activity so the user can use the application in any orientation and provide a great experience on Chrome OS devices [LockedOrientationActivity]
            android:screenOrientation="portrait">
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LockedOrientationActivity":
   The <activity> element should not be locked to any orientation so that
   users can take advantage of the multi-window environments and larger
   screens available on Android. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding activity element with `screenOrientation="unspecified"or
   "fullSensor"` attribute.

/workspaces/Texas-Hold-em-Chip-Simulator/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:23: Warning: Should not restrict activity to fixed orientation. This may not be suitable for different form factors, causing the app to be letterboxed. [DiscouragedApi]
            android:screenOrientation="portrait">
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DiscouragedApi":
   Discouraged APIs are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
   for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior).

/workspaces/Texas-Hold-em-Chip-Simulator/app/src/main/res/drawable/bilibili_default_avatar.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/bilibili_default_avatar.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
